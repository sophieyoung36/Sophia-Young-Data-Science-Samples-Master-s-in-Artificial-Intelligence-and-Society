Sophia Young - Programming Skills: Three Data Science Projects

Of the many projects I conducted as a data science student at University of California, Berkeley, I have selected the following projects to demonstrate my foundational understanding of the core elements required for my research proposal, including familiarity with classification systems, feature engineering pipelines, model fine-tuning, machine learning techniques, and data ethics. 

Files 1.a. and 1.b. correspond to Project 1: Machine Learning to Create a Linear Regression Model

Files 2.a. and 2.b. correspond to Project 2: Machine Learning Logistics Regression to Create a Binary Classifier

File 3 corresponds to Project 3: Object-Oriented Programming and Abstraction
