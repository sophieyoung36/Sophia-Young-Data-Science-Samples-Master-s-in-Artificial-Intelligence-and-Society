    "In our models, we evaluate the accuracy of the training set, which may provide a misleading accuracy measure. In Project B1, we calculated various metrics to consider other ways of evaluating a classifier, in addition to overall accuracy. Below is a reference to those concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presumably, our classifier will be used for **filtering**, or preventing messages labeled `spam` from reaching someone's inbox. There are two kinds of errors we can make:\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels. False positives and false negatives may be of differing importance, leading us to consider more ways of evaluating a classifier in addition to overall accuracy:\n",

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. To get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **85%** accuracy on both the train and test set (see Question 3 for the partial credit breakdown). To determine your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` `DataFrame` and upload your predictions to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will only be able to submit your test set predictions to Gradescope up to 4 times per day**. You will be able to see your accuracy on the entire test set when submitting to Gradescope. Note that attempts will not carry over across days, so we recommend planning ahead to make sure you have enough time to finetune your model! In the case that you are approved for an extension, you are granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!'s were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number/percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. Alternatively, you can identify misclassified emails and see which relevant words are missing in your model.\n",
    "1. Reducing dimensionality and/or multicollinearity. There are a few methods to achieve this:\n",
    "    1. Interpret the model coefficients. Note that a feature will be more valuable in classification if its coefficient has a larger **absolute** value. If the coefficient has a lower **absolute** value, the feature likely isn't valuable in classifying emails.\n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust the parameters of your model (e.g. the penalty type, the regularization parameter, or any arguments in `LogisticRegression`) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation for feature and model selection! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "    1. Consider implementing L1 regularization. The [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for `LogisticRegression` may be helpful here. \n",
    "    1. We have imported `GridSearchCV` for you. You may use sklearn's `GridSearchCV` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)) class to perform cross-validation. You do not need to code cross-validation from scratch, though you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `GridSearchCV`. Suppose we wanted to experiment with 4 different solvers (numerical methods for optimizing the mode) models for a `LogisticRegression` model `lr_model`. \n",
    "1. We could define a dictionary specifying the hyperparameters and the specific values we want to try out like so: `parameters = {'solver':[{'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'saga']}`.\n",
    "2. Running `grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr_model, param_grid=parameters)` would give us a model for each combination of hyperparameters we are testing - in this case, just 4 models.\n",
    "3. We fit each model to some training data `X_train` and `Y_train` using `grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, Y_train)`.\n",
    "4. Indexing into `grid_result.cv_results_` with a particular metric (in this case, `mean_test_score`), we get an array with the scores corresponding to each of the models. `grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']`.\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with other hyperparameters and metrics as well. The documentation is your friend!     \n",
    "       \n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer to create features, but **you may only use the packages we've imported for you in the cell below or earlier in this notebook**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No decision trees, random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** You may want to use your **validation data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the test set. However, you may overfit to your validation set if you try to optimize your validation accuracy too much. Alternatively, you can perform cross-validation on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** If you see a `ConvergenceWarning`, increase the maximum number of iterations the model runs for by passing in a parameter, `max_iter`, into `LogisticRegression()`. This should get rid of the warning. For a longer discussion on why this warning appears, you might find [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62658215/convergencewarning-lbfgs-failed-to-converge-status-1-stop-total-no-of-iter) helpful. Convergence of solvers is not in scope for Data 100, but by understanding what the error messages are saying, you can get some useful context on what to do in these situations."

    "1. I found better features for my model by picking words to in the words_in_texts function that occurred in a much higher proportion of spam emails than ham emails, using the insight I gained through my visualization in Question 1 that spam emails have a significantly higher word count than spam emails, and using the hint included in the problem setup to check use the frequency of \"!\" in emails. I checked the effectiveness of features by observing changes in validation and training accuracy set prediction after adding features to the model. Lastly, I created a sns.heatmap of my features to check for multicollinearity and ensure I was not creating instability in the model's coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I tried creating features for the 'subject' column but realized through observing NO changes in validation and training accuracy set prediction that the subject features I made were fairly useless (so I edited them out). I also tried using more words for the words_in_texts function but found that some of these words were significantly correlated with existing features, which increased the risk of multicollinearity. Checking my model on the validation set worked well and helped ensure I was not overfitting on my training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I was surprised that my chosen features didn't have more multicollinearity. \"drug\" and \"prescription\" had the highest correlation of about 0.5 (which is significant), but it did not increase my model accuracy when I removed either feature (which was also of note). This might be because \"drug\" and \"prescription\" were less influential features in my model compared to \"word_count\" and the number of exclamation points and because they contribute redundant information."

    "\n",
    "In most cases, we won't be able to get 0 false positives and 0 false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover that they have cancer until it's too late. In contrast, a patient can receive another screening for a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a particular class. To classify an example, we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, **we can adjust that cutoff threshold**. We can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve shows this trade-off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Gradescope) on the training data. [Lecture 23](https://ds100.org/fa24/lecture/lec23/) may be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You'll want to use the `.predict_proba` method [(documentation)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict_proba) for your classifier instead of `.predict` to get probabilities instead of binary predictions."

This bias and noise will in turn affect how our model classifies \"spam\" and \"ham\". \n",

Further, we should try to understand how and where the data was collected (was it a convenience sample? How many people was it collected from? Was it only collected in one country, only from one socio-economic class? etc). While the model may perform well on test, validation, and training sets, its real-world performance could be impaired by inherent biases and inconsistencies in the labeled data.\n",

Further, online content moderation has raised free speech issues and even led to legal action. Therefore, it is important that other humans (such as judges, legal scholars, and elected officials) can interpret and assess the justness of our model. Lastly, as data scientists and content moderators, we should have a moral duty to be transparent with our users. Model interpretability is central to this transparency."

However, it is equally important to note that interpretability on its own isn’t a fix to all the problems that may arise when moderating content or when building a model more generally. As we touched on in Project A2, these models don’t operate in a vacuum; they exist in a wider sociotechnical system. Everything from the data used to train these models to the metrics we choose to evaluate our models builds on that notion."
